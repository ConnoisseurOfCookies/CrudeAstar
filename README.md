<h1>Crude Astar</h1>

<p>Can be used <a href="https://connoisseurofcookies.github.io/CrudeAstar/">here<a/> </p>

<p>This was my first attempt at an Astar implementation using JS and, additionally, my first successful attempt at demonstrating an algorithm through a graphical interface.</p>
<br/>
<p>As a matter of fact I am actually rather proud of this one since I managed to implement it using only pseudocode and without peeking into someone else's code.</p>
<br/>
<p>I thought it was an insightful experience that gave me a greater appreciation for the inner workings of algorithms</p>
